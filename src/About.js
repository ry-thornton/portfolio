                    Hi there! My name is Ryan Thornton, and I am 26 year old full stack software engineer with inclination toward front-end technologies.
                    Currently I work at as the lead web engineer at GOffee, a consumer services startup helping people get their morning coffee via office and residential delivery!

                    After graduating from Fordham University with a bachelor of science degree in Psychology, I spent time working in the mental health field, and I still have a passion for working with people.  However, with an interest in creative work, I decided to shift my focus towards a career in software.
                    I felt that programming provided me with the skills necessary to combine my passion for people with art and creativity in an impactful way. With formal education in software engineering from Flatiron School, I have been able to use programming fundamentals and various technologies to build innovative and user-centered applications.
